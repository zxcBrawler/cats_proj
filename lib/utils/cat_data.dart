        "Soft, snowy, and oh-so-cuddly, pure white cats are some of nature's prettiest (and most adorable) works of feline art. Unlike gray or black felines, which can easily hide in the shadows, it's hard to miss a cat sporting a white coat that practically glows. Note that white cats are not a specific breed, but rather, many different cat breeds can have white coats that vary in length. And of course, white cats can have a variety of different eye colors, although many have magnificent blue eyes, or even eyes of two different colors.While every feline has its own unique beauty, mystique, and interesting history and habits, white cats have many facts specific to their snowy coats. We've gathered some pictures of beautiful white cats, along with fun facts to grow your admiration for these felines.",
