    "1. Whisker Fatigue: Cats use their whiskers not only for navigation but also to gauge the width of openings. Known as 'whisker fatigue,' if a cat's whiskers touch too many surfaces, they may become overwhelmed and stressed.",
    "2. Purring for Healing: Cats purr not only when content but also when injured or in pain. The frequency of a cat's purring has been suggested to have therapeutic effects, promoting healing and reducing pain and inflammation.",
    "3. High-Jump Champions: Domestic cats are exceptional jumpers, and some breeds can leap up to six times their body length in a single bound. This ability stems from their powerful hind leg muscles and flexible spine.",
    "4. Night Vision Gurus: Cats have excellent night vision, thanks to a high number of rod cells in their retinas. This adaptation allows them to see in light levels six times lower than what a human needs. It's no wonder they are often most active during the twilight hours.",
    "5. Catnip Sensitivity: Not all cats are affected by catnip, but for those that are, the reaction can be quite entertaining. Catnip sensitivity is inherited, and it is estimated that around 50-75% of cats are affected by the plant. The response includes rolling, purring, and temporary euphoria."
